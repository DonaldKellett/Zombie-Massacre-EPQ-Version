# Zombie-Massacre-EPQ-Version

A version of my classic SVG-Javascript browser shooting game used for submission for my AS Extended Project.  You may **NOT** use these files for your own submission of **ANY** qualification as that is tantamount to plagiarism.

## Overview

- Version: `Extended Project`
- Status: Stable
- License: **None - this work is copyrighted**

## How to play the game

This game is [available online on Naitsabes](http://naitsabes.com/extended-project) (**NOTE**: link may be **temporary**).  Alternatively, if you want to play this game offline, simply follow the steps listed below:

1. Download all the files from this repository
2. Find the `index.svg` file which should be in the root directory.  **Drag and drop it into the browser of your choice to start playing (Safari NOT recommended).**  If you just double-click on the file, you will open up the source code instead.

## Synopsis

- `index.html` - A file that simply redirects to `index.svg` so if the game is uploaded onto a website, the game is immediately playable by visiting the homepage of the website itself
- `index.svg` - The main game file that includes all the important SVG *and* Javascript code.  **Important**
- `assets/` - A folder that contains all the important music and SFX files for the game.  **Important**
- `zombies/` - A folder containing all the standalone SVG files for each and every sprite in the game (excluding the background).

In addition, the `params.json` and `README.md` files are for use on GitHub only and do not count as actual project files.
